MFT Security Descriptor Control Flags: determines how security descriptor should be interpreted
    SE_OWNER_DEFAULTED: owner SID was set by default mechanism (can be used by resource manager)
    SE_GROUP_DEFAULTED: group SID was set by default mechanism (can be used by resource manager)
    SE_DACL_PRESENT: indicates whether the security descriptor has a DACL (if null or is set 
                     and DALC is null, full permissions on object are granted to everyone)
    SE_DACL_DEFAULTED: indicates the security descriptor has a default DACL (i.e. if a user
                       does not specify a DACL on creation of an object, that object will receive
                       the default DACL of the user's access token)
    SE_SACL_PRESENT: indicates whether the security descriptor has an SACL
    SE_SACL_DEFAULTED: indicates whether a default mechanism set the SACL
    SE_DACL_AUTO_INHERIT_REQ: indicates a required security descriptor in which the DACL supports
                              automatic propogation of inheritable access control entries to child objects
    SE_SACL_AUTO_INHERIT_REQ: indicates a required security descriptor in which the SACL supports
                              automatic propogation of inheritable access control entries to child objects
    SE_DACL_AUTO_INHERITED: same as SE_DACL_AUTO_INHERIT_REQ, but for non-required security descriptors
    SE_SACL_AUTO_INHERITED: same as SE_SACL_AUTO_INHERIT_REQ, but for non-required security descriptors
    SE_DACL_PROTECTED: prevents DACL from being modified by inheritable access control entries
    SE_SACL_PROTECTED: prevents SACL from being modified by inheritable access control entries
    SE_RM_CONTROL_VALID: indicates that the resource manager control is valid
    SE_SELF_RELATIVE: whether the security descriptor is in absolute or self-relative format
                      (absolute security descriptors contain pointers to the information, whereas
                      self-relative security descriptors contain the information in a contiguous 
                      memory/disk block)
